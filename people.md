## Robbie Walker

Robbie is a 23-Year-old American woman and artist.
Robbie is a 3D artist at Reckworks with whom I have had the pleasure of collaborating on occasion, however since I prefer to work in 2D we've yet to have the opportunity to truly work together.

Alice is Reckworks Studio's go-to storyteller and proofreader, Alice is an absolute joy to work with and always inspirational and I'm extremely excited to get to work with her on more upcoming projects.
