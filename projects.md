## Reckworks Game Studios
Reckworks Game Studios is a small team of indie, mostly hobbyist, developers and artists who love to participate in game jams. A Game Jam is a timed competition where developers are placed under specific constraights and a very tight time crunch to release a project which fits into certain criterea.

### Released Projects

#### [Cellular Surge](https://kchem.itch.io/cellular-surge)
Cellular Surge is the Project I'm most proud of as I was able to take the lead in most areas of it's development, the theme of the GoGodot Game Jam it was built for lended it'self perfectly to a game which utalized my expertese and passion for biochemistry. You can play the game for yourself on Itch.io by visiting https://kchem.itch.io/cellular-surge
Cellular Surge is a challenging puzzle game where the goal is to balance the eco system of a petri-dish by adding microbes which balance certain variables, all more or less based on the parts of chemistry experiments I enjoy. This Game was built completely from scratch in just one week and was the first game that I or [Anthony Hampton](https://k-dallas.github.io/people/) whom I worked with ever made. It did respectably in it's competition getting 4th place for innovation, 17th place for theme, and 16th overall out of nearly 200 submission, nearly making finals nominations for it's category.

### Upcomming Projects

#### Unnamed Rougelike Project
I along with Reckworks Game Studios are planning the creation of a Rougelike dungeon crawler which will have an alchemic and monsterous theme that should start development in the coming weeks.
