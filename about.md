### Hello, I'm Kathryn Dallas.
###### She/Her

I'm a 20-year-old third-year biochemistry major studying at California Polytechnic in San Luis Obispo. <br>
I have a deep passion for organic chemistry and especially CRISPR, ever since I saw a live demonstration at a summer camp as a child, the fascination and curiosity that event sparked has never left me and I don't think it will anytime soon. I truly believe it is at the forefront of not only our field but the entire world of science as a whole. <br>
I'm also a fledgling game developer and artist currently working with ReckWorks Game Studios, you can see some of my current and upcoming projects [here](https://k-dallas.github.io/projects/) <br>
